# Perl Boogle

Play a game of boogle in your own private cloud!  Share your screen with
friends and family.  All you need is a web server that can run a Perl CGI
script -- is that too much to ask?

If you're curious, or you don't want to host your own, you can check out a
running instance [here](http://boogle.dabreese00.net).  Enjoy!

If you're reading this, be warned that the code is as janky as it gets.  It was
written almost entirely between 6 and 10 years ago, back when I knew nothing;
forgive me.  It works, and I'm too lazy to refactor it.  On the plus side, I
think it's quite short and readable for a web application.

And... it's Dockerized!  Did you ever think you'd see a Dockerized Perl CGI
application?  Fun stuff.
